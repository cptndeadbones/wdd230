      <h2>Maryland: Temple Inn Suites CEO and Founder</h2>
      <h3>Alex Proksch</h3>
      <p>We hope you enjoy your stay at Temple Inn Suites and are able to feel the spirit of the Lord while you are here. Temple 
        Inn Suites was founded to help members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints get the very most out of their 
        temple trips. Having a family of my own I realized how import it is to go to the Lords house regularly. But having small 
        children made that a challenge. That is why we started to offer a childrens short term play room and daycare center to 
        all of our locations. Until they are old enough to feel the spirit in the Lords house we hope that the little ones can
        feel the spirit here too. Now let us get to work for we are all enlisted and called to serve.
