        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <h3>Dribble / Moseychuk Slava</h3>

        <p>On the website Dribble, the designer Moseychuk Slava posted one of his designs that exemplifies the key design principal contrast.
         When we think of contrast typically the colors black and white come to mind. Contrast can also be achieved in color by using opposing
         colors on the color wheel. You may have seen some of these combinations before. Red and green, purple and yellow, blue and orange.
         These are just a few, however there is so much more than color when dealing with contrast.</p>  
         <p>Contrast could be a difference in size. You can have very large items on a web page and very small text. The difference in size between
         these two elements can create a stark contrast of size.  So next time you think about contrast, try not to think so much about color but 
         more about opposites.</p>
         
         <p>Some of the key contrasting elements we see on this page are the big bold letters in the center of the page that reads "Mars". Another 
             good example of contrast here is the bright red combind with white and black color scheme. Lastly I really like the square in the
            center of the page that contrasts with the circle of the planet.<p>

        <h2>White space and clean design.</h2>
        <h3>Company / organizations name</h3>
        <p>Website: Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/"></a></p>

        <p>What is white space? White space is the negative space or blank space in between items on a web page. White space is important for a couple
        of reasons. Number one, it can break up large chunks of text and help a user understand grouping in the design. Because white space helps to 
        break things up in design it can also help a user's understanding of content. Number 2, it can add importance or value to certain aspects of a design.
         By not having other items cluttered around a topic and coupled with contrast, white space help a user to focus on what the designer wants them to see.</p>

         <p>I really like Apple's website for the use of white space. Apple exemplifies this design charateristic to help sell their phones and other products. 
             They leave a lot of white space around the product so that nothing can distract from the beautiful sleek design. Any text is also surrounded by lots of 
             white space. The text on the page does not get lengthy, instead, text is direct, short and to the point. To me Apple has specialy designed this page for
             one purpose, sales.</p>
