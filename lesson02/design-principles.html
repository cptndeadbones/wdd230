                <p><b>Website: Dribble </b><br><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/5298824-K-R-A-I/attachments/1149295">https://dribbble.com/shots/5298824-K-R-A-I/attachments/1149295</a></p>

                <p class="content-spacing" id="whitespace">On the website Dribble, the designer Zak Steele-Eklund posted a
                    sample of a website he had built. This site Krai beautifully showcases many design principles such as 
                    contrast, whitespace, visual hierarchy and many others. I particularly liked this site because of the 
                    over all aesthetic and consistancy that gives users confidence as they browes the site.</p>
                    
                <p class="content-spacing">One of the greastest examples of contrast on the site is the use 
                    of purple and its complementary colors yellow and orange. There is such a natural contrast between these 
                    two colors that it does not strain the eye. These colors coupled with the soft round features just make 
                    the overall feel of the site inviting.</p>

            <h3>Company: Monolith</h3>
            <p><b>Website: Dribble</b><br><a href="https://dribbble.com/Radium/projects/725683-Product"> https://dribbble.com/Radium/projects/725683-Product</a></p>
            <img src="/wdd230/lesson02/images/cosmincapitanuwhitespace.PNG" alt="Monolith a concept webpage for an A.I. personal assistant.">
            <p class="content-spacing" id="whitespace">Monolith is a concept website that showcases off the idea of an A.I. personal assistant.
                This simple design uses a two column aproach with an image and a text content section on each row. This minimal amount of content
                keeps the overall feel of the site looking clean and open. By using white space the designer is able to keep the users attention 
                on the most relevant parts of the website.</p>
                <p class="content-spacing"> An added benefit to using white space and clean design, is that it lends it self to the clean sleek 
                    visual apperance of the product. Overall it is a very lite clean and refreshing design.</p>

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3>Company: Dex</h3>
            <p><b>Website: Black on White Design Trend</b><br><a href="https://medium.muz.li/black-on-white-design-trend-497e51e108ea#.9sw0bxtzu">
                https://medium.muz.li/black-on-white-design-trend-497e51e108ea#.9sw0bxtzu</a></p>
            <img src="/wdd230/lesson02/images/dexhierarchy.PNG" alt="Homepage image of the website Dex large hierarcle letters and images.">
            <p class="content-spacing" id="whitespace">When it comes to visual hierarchy Dex does an amazing job. This website imediately 
                grabs your attention with a large letter D. As your eyes are naturally drawn to the center of the page they start to find the next 
                most important item, smaller text. Once your eyes have finished analyzing the first section they leap to the picture in the
                next section with the black background.</p>
                <p class="content-spacing">By using hierarchy in his design Dex is able to deliver a large amount of content in a very consumable 
                    way. In fact the website almost reads like a book. One of the ways Dex rewards his users is by starting each section with a 
                    letter of his name. It is not until you reach the bottom of the page that you realize what he did in spelling out or branding 
                    his product further.</p>
