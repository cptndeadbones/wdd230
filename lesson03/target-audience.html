        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>Persona 1</h3>
        <p>The target audience for Nimbus Weather would be people of small town farming communities. These could be farmers, landscapers and other memebers of agriculture
            communities. Ideally this first persona would be a male farmer who grows wheat, potatoes and possibly corn. Due to the nature of these crops it would be very 
            benaficial to know when to plant and harvest since some crops like wheat can suffer from deseases like blight and other types of rot.  This farmer would be 
            intelegent with a 4 year degree most likely in business managment. He would have grown up on a farm and have roughly 20 years farming. This farmer would be a 
            problem solver.  
        </p>
        <p>Reason he would visit the site? He would visit the site to get weather updates from day to day and forcast his crops but he would also come to the site to
            communicate with other members of the community. The participate in local activities with his family and stay up to date on news in the area. He would visit the
            site early in the morning while he was fixing or eatting his breakfast before he left for work that day. He might check back again in the evening depending on 
            what the next days tasks would be. I would expect this farmer to use the site roughly an hour a day, surfing or reading articles. He might use the site to 
            find out where local events are being held. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Motivations would be crop success and better qulity of life for himself and his family. Part of this motivation would encourage loyalty due to site reliability.
