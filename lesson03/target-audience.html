        <h3>Persona 1</h3>
        <p>The target audience for Nimbus Weather would be people of small town farming communities. These could be farmers, landscapers and other memebers of agriculture
            communities. Ideally this first persona would be a male farmer who grows wheat, potatoes and possibly corn. Due to the nature of these crops it would be very 
            benaficial to know when to plant and harvest since some crops like wheat can suffer from deseases like blight and other types of rot.  This farmer would be 
            intelegent with a 4 year degree most likely in business managment. He would have grown up on a farm and have roughly 20 years farming. This farmer would be a 
            problem solver.  
        </p>
        <p>Reason he would visit the site? He would visit the site to get weather updates from day to day and forcast his crops but he would also come to the site to
            communicate with other members of the community. The participate in local activities with his family and stay up to date on news in the area. He would visit the
            site early in the morning while he was fixing or eatting his breakfast before he left for work that day. He might check back again in the evening depending on 
            what the next days tasks would be. I would expect this farmer to use the site roughly an hour a day, surfing or reading articles. He might use the site to 
            find out where local events are being held. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Motivations would be crop success and better qulity of life for himself and his family. Part of this motivation would encourage loyalty due to site reliability.

        <h3>Persona 2</h3>
        <p>
            The second target audience persona for Nimbus Weather is a woman roughly 27 years of age. She would be a currently enrolled college student. Here work experience
            be mostly simple jobs to get her through college such as, fast food, baby sitting, and other customer service related job. As far as professional background, she
            would rely mostly on her current college experience as an enviromental science major. So why would she want to come to Nimbus Weather?
        </p>
        <p>
            She would come to Nimbus to get updates and schedules on local events in the community and to connect with other active outgoing like minded individuals. She 
            would choose this site because this is a fun and constantly updated site. Her alternatives would be governement driven sites like parks and rec as well as 
            library bulletin sites. Since these generally don't get updated all that often Nimbus would provided a more reliable solution. 
        </p>
        <p>Tech, how would she acces the site? She would access this site mostly on the phone. This could be in cases after a homework session where she needs a break
            and to get out of the house. She may look at Nimbus Weather inbetween homework sessions. Therfore I could see her using a desktop, but the focus would be on the
        mobile view. Depending on homework schedule she could even use this site daily. Other apps she might use and would be familiar with would be Google, instagram, 
    facebook, and even pintrest.</p>
        <p>Motivation, her motivation to continually visit the site would be the constant updates. That way she could not only stay up to date on weather but events too.</p>
