        <h2 id="targetHeader">Target Audience</h2>

        <section id="persona1">
        <h3>Persona 1</h3>
        <p>The target audience for Micro Burst Weather would be the people of a suburb community to Charlotte North Carolina specifically Lake Wiley.
            This person would be a working class individual who commutes from the suburbs Monday through Friday. This person is a manager at a university
            for their maintenance team. This person is also the father of a small family with two kids. He is 31 years old and makes roughly 50K a year.<br>
            <br>
            Reason he would visit the site? He would visit the site to get weather updates from day to day and forcast for his area around his house and where 
            he works in Charlotte. The benefit of the is site to him would be, being able to plan daily activities and prepare for storms approriately. He would 
            use the site on the weekends to plan his yard work chores around the house. Durring the week he would check the site first thing he got to work as
            part of an early news breif. This site would also offer him local community event information as well as community news stories. <br>
            <br>
            Motivation to visit the site regularly would be to get constant updates on local events and weather status. Through continued reliable use, 
            this would create loyalty. 
        </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Persona 2-->
        <section id="persona2">
        <h3>Persona 2</h3>
        <p>The second target audience persona for Micro Burst Weather would be a local farmer that grows fresh produce for their roadside produce stand. This 
            person would be up early almost everyday taking care of farm chores. They would be 60% self sufficient living off their own garden. She would be a 
            Mom of 3 boys. Her favorite past times would be spent with her family. <br>
            <br>
            She would come to Micro Burst Weather to get updates and schedules on local events in the community and to connect with other active outgoing farmers. She 
            would choose this site because it is fun and is constantly updated. This site would also be a source of news and weather for crops and places harvest could
            be transported to for sale. I could see this site being invaluable to the farms success. The farmer could also post events at her farm on the site to help 
            driver her family business and be an active member of the community driving local commerce.<br>
            <br>
            Tech, how would she acces the site? She would access this site mostly on the phone. However at home she might use a desk top simply to have a larger view of
            web pages and have the comfort of a mouse. I see this farmer being in her mid 40's and not super comfortable with mobile devices yet. That being said, 
            because of this adversity to mobile devices any mobile designs need to utilize white space and good design principles to make her feel comfrotable on 
            mobile view and not overwhelmed.<br>
            <br>
            Motivation: her motivation to continually visit the site would be the constant updates as well as using the site to drive the success of her family farm 
            business.
